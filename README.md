I write Haskell and Bitcoin code at Bitnomial. Previously, I worked in financial technology consulting, and I co-founded PeerTrader, a peer-to-peer lending automating investment platform. I studied Physics and Mathematics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I worked on simulations and data analysis for statistical models of complex phenomena.

My general interests include:

- Bitcoin
- Haskell
- Cryptography and security
- Compilers and programming languages
- Physics
- Mathematics
- Computer graphics
- Rock climbing
- Emacs
- Human languages
